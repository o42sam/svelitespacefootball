We are dedicated to discovering, developing and promoting young African football talent. Our vision is to create a platform for aspiring teenage footballers to showcase their skills and potential to the world. Our mission is to provide them with the best training, guidance and exposure possible, through our academy system and our network of contacts in the European football industry. We are not an agency, but a partner and a mentor for our players. We believe in the value of discipline, and passion for the game. We are Elite Space Football.
